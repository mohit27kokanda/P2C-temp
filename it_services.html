        </p>
        <p>
          Stage2: Testing
        </p>
        <p>
          Stage3: Hardware cost for testing and deploying the android mobile application
        </p>
      
        <h5>2.Easy to Integrate :</h5>
        <p>An Android App can be the best solution for complex technical customization and integration of a
          web application or just a Smartphone application you already have. Android is the best mobile
          platform between the application and processes helping you to integrate the apps.
        </p>
      
        <h5>3.Customizable User Interface : </h5>
        <p>Apps developed using Android platform are highly customizable and very easy to manage. This is a
          great boost for android app development companies to flourish their business by making custom
          android apps for business. Even the data management and multimedia tools can be updated easily.

            This solution is a mixture, hence the name hybrid, of both native and web solutions. The core of the
            application is written using the most famous web technologies that are: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            (JS), which are then encapsulated within a native application. Through the use of plugins, these
            applications can easily access all features of mobile devices the heart of a hybrid-mobile
            application is still just an application that is written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However,
            instead of the app being shown within the user’s browser, it is run from within a native application
            and its own embedded browser, which is essentially invisible to the user. Therefore, there is an
            increasing demand for Hybrid app development in the world. In this growing market, to find someone
            with expertise on Hybrid app solution has become very difficult for start-ups and projects.

          <h2 class="theme-color text-left">The Benefits of Hybrid Application Development </h2>
          <br>
      
          <h5>1. Enhanced UI/UX : </h5>
          <p>Hybrid App Development offers a consistent and flawless user experience across IOS, Android
            platforms. Hybrid applications are about making it work for mobile by embracing the web. Further,
            the lightweight hybrid app UI helps in loading content and graphics quickly. The apps adapt faster
            to different device screens for faster data display and seamless data streaming. The excellent UI
            experience even improves the chances of the application’s approval at the app store.
          </p>
          <h5>2. Lesser Costs :</h5>
          <p>The most significant advantages of hybrid apps are that they come up with reduced development
            costs. The hybrid mobile development approach enables targeting multiple platforms without
            maintaining numerous code bases. Unlike native apps, hybrid applications use a single code base for
            various platforms. Thus, it allows the development teams to increase the speed of development
            process, which reduces the time for product to come in the market. Also, it will enable them to
            reach a larger number of users.</p>
      
          <h5>3. Improved Performance of Apps : </h5>
          <p>Hybrid apps offer high speed and performance just like native apps. In fact, in some cases, they
            are even faster than various progressive and responsive apps. The reason is that there is no
            dependency on network communication. Further, even apps with a higher number of users exhibit better
            speed on almost all devices. Hybrid apps have already proven their high speed and performance
            standards with brands like Twitter and LinkedIn. </p>
      
          <h5>4. Reusing the code of the web app part : </h5>
          <p> The code is written once and deployed across all mobile platforms. </p>
      
          <h5>5. Reducing Development Time and Costs : </h5>
          <p>The code is written once, which substantially reduces development time and costs as compared to
            native apps which require development for iOS as well as development for Android.</p>

            iPhone users are cushioned against hacking and malware. This again is a reason why iOS application
            is preferred over android application.
          </p>
      
          <h5>2. Better App Revenue :</h5>
          <p>iPhone apps have a greater ROI than Android apps. This is the fact that adds on to the benefits of
            iOS App development, to a large extent.</p>
      
          <h5>3. Tech-Ready Audience :</h5>
          <p>iPhone users are found to be IT-literate and open-minded towards innovation. This presents
            businesses with numerous opportunities to design challenging applications that can create disruption
            in markets. Businesses that opt for iPhone app development can become market leaders and can take a
            long step ahead of their competitors.</p>
      
          <h5>4. Low Fragmentation & Easy Testing :</h5>
          <p>Apple typically develops just one update on its existing OS every year. Also, the number of Apple
            devices are lesser in number than Android-based ones. Hence, Android apps must be tested
            comprehensively to check its working on all the versions of Android OS. iPhone apps just must meet
            testing criteria of the prevalent iOS versions. This reduces testing time considerably and
            guarantees a quick time to market for iOS apps. </p>
