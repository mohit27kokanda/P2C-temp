                        Imagine a herd of sheep following their leader without any knowledge of which direction they are
                        being led to? Rather, just following the leader blindfolded. And now, what if the leader jumps into
                        a trench, what is going to happen next? Slowly and gradually, the whole herd is going to follow the
                        leader and going to diminish one by one. <strong class="theme-color">Right?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now ,let me draw an analogy here. The leader of the herd is the drive to become a corporate
                        professional, the herd is the group of people who just want to do what everyone is doing
                        irrespective of exploring their potential. They just want to run in a rat race and prove to be the
                        fastest rat around. And the trench here represents unexpected <strong class="theme-color">Covid-19 crisis </strong> that
                        shook the corporate world. But what now? How will these blindfolded professionals sprinting in a rat
                        race be able to get back on track? This group of people has never learnt to develop an acumen to
                        tackle such risky situations. So, what now ?

                <p>
                    Don’t you think this has been made the trend of our education system, where the top scorers are just
                    supposed to become engineers or doctors? Why don’t anyone’s parents dream of their child becoming an
                    entrepreneur? Jobs provide security and guaranteed income, agreed. But what if even
                    <strong class="theme-color">Dhirubhai Ambani </strong> and <strong class="theme-color">Rattan Tata</strong> would have preferred security of
                    their job over following their dreams and passion, would we have been able to witness an industrial
                    revolution in Indian market? Entrepreneurship is a venture which though involves risk but at the
                    same time, if accompanied by hard work and going an extra mile, even guarantees rich dividends. And
                    the skills that one develops while handling real life situations independently can only be owed to
                    real life experiences.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now ,let us consider the current situation. <strong class="theme-color">India</strong>, the nation which once used to be
                    a plethora of economic opportunities and attract thousands of now job seekers is witnessing a
                    downfall. Moreover, the<strong class="theme-color"> Covid-19</strong> pandemic has worsened the situation and has left
                    gigantic number of sagacious professionals jobless as well apart from snatching away the livelihood
                    of thousands of labourers. But these jobs did not have any risk factor, right? Then why did this
                    happen? And since this has happened already then how are these people going to face it? The
                    corporate professionals who have always been spoon fed by the companies and are hardly having any
                    industry experience of leading a venture completely of their own?
                </p>


                <p>
                    What use of a post-graduation degree is if someone still lacks any concrete skill that can guarantee
                    him a livelihood?<strong class="theme-color"> Self-sufficient India</strong>, the dream of our <strong class="theme-color">Honourable Prime
                    Minister</strong> certainly aims at the professionals creating jobs for others and become
                    independent. Moreover, the <strong class="theme-color">Make in India</strong> campaign launched earlier was also
                    primarily focused to give a boost to the start-up culture that is still very much underrated in our
                    country. Our youth does not lack anywhere intellectually but the allotment of resources and funds by
                    the government of India is still something where they have to suffer, and flight of their creativity
                    faces a major impediment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Legalising the rules and their implementation throughout the country are two totally different
                    things which have a major role to play in enhancing the start-up culture. Of what use is taking a
                    horse to a well but not getting a bucket of water out for him to drink? Likewise, how can the new
                    regulations pass and stored in files be of any help to the budding entrepreneurs who want financial
                    assistance. There have been multiple incidents in the past when a team of passionate individuals
                    could not make the best out of their potential. Moreover, the support and encouragement that most of
                    us have for our fellow budding entrepreneurs is certainly not doing justice with their talent. When
                    was the last time you appreciated the idea of your friend which he wanted to implement in real life
                    and develop it more? Emotional support and appreciation from our friends certainly play a key role
                    in determining our course of action.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The current situation is certainly indicative of the fact that it is the dire need of the hour to
                    bring about a concrete change in our education system and focus more on teaching entrepreneurial
                    skills and skill development of the students in order to make them self-sufficient enough that they
                    can not only lead their own <strong class="theme-color">start-ups</strong> but also provide a plethora of opportunities
                    for many. Leadership is an inherent trait of Indians and it is needless to mention that time and
                    again women have proved their acumen of leadership consistently and should be motivated and
                    encouraged to initiate ventures of their own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More and more policies and campaigns should be initiated to inculcate the values of support and
                    motivation in the entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the organisation of events and competitions related to
                    designing products, exploring business ideas, discussing strategies and case studies need to be
                    enhanced to make young minds learn the entrepreneurial skills right away from childhood. This
                    exposure will not only boost their confidence but will also play an instrumental role in making them
                    understand entrepreneurship closely and take a mature decision when it comes to pursuing a career.
                </p>

                <p>With the advancements in science and technology, social media, and digital marketing domains, that
                    have been unexplored since long must be made use of and tapped to the fullest of their potential.
                    Even though MNCs have inculcated these recent advancements in their work culture, small scale
                    <strong class="theme-color">entrepreneurial ventures</strong> however lack at making the best use out of them. If these
                    domains are uniformly publicised and explored, then even the start-ups are not far from progressing
                    on the path of success. Amidst this corona crisis, more and more digitalization is certainly a step
                    that we should take to increase the ease of business in near future. Rather than viewing this crisis
                    as a stop, we should see it as a pause for sure. This preparatory leave needs to be made full use of
                    to smoothen our way through upcoming challenges. </p>

                <p>Even though there is no one single answer to the question being asked in the subtitle, however we
                    can say that where jobs are full-fledged established in our country, entrepreneurships are still
                    like a bud that if given proper nurturing in the form of motivation, resources, funds and liberal
                    government policies have a huge possibility of blossoming into one of the most sought-after
                    professions in our nation. Having a knack of taking risks, exceptional innovation and creativity
                    skills and a desire to achieve what one desires at any cost is all that it takes to become a
                    successful entrepreneur.

                        Though, the human race might not have evolved much biologically over the years, but the way women
                        see themselves and how they want the society to look at them has radically evolved over the period
                        of time. During the recent years, women have shifted the,

                      <p>
                        The rise of entrepreneurship culture among women in India has led the movement of a substantial
                        change in mindsets and behavioral patterns of the society as a whole. It has changed the way women
                        see themselves, it has changed the way their male counterparts see them, and it has been serving as
                        an undying inspiration for little girls for transforming their dreams into reality. People are no
                        more looking with the eyes of suspicion when a woman approaches them to rent an apartment and to
                        live alone.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        These small changes can influence great things. I mean just think if a landlord just denied to rent
                        an apartment in Bangalore to the founders of Flipkart , right where the e-commerce giant started,
                        then maybe things wouldn’t have been the same as they are today.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        Not just societal changes, but this culture has also taken the Indian economy on a ride. As of now,
                        women constitute 14% of the entrepreneurs in India but as per a study by <strong class="theme-color">McKinsey</strong>,
                        equal participation of women in India has cause a spike in India’s GDP by 16-60% by 2025,
                        contributing an addition of $2.9 trillion to the economy. Not only they contribute in terms of
                        <strong class="theme-color">GDP</strong> but also tend to generate a chunk of employment especially for women who want
                        to step out of their domestic domains and demonstrate their skill development and potential to be a
                        part of their families not only socially, but also economically. As per the statements of rising
                        women entrepreneurs of the country, many of them provides employment to women who want to restart
                        their careers after they have been handcuffed with a plethora of cultural and social barriers and
                        prove to the world again their sense of commitment and dedication towards work.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        While the <strong class="theme-color">UN convention</strong> has placed gender equality at a stature of priority as they
                        listed it as one of the sustainable development goals of 2030, some of the Indian women has proved
                        that empowerment of women will not only fulfill one of their sustainable goals but rather accomplish
                        the very idea of sustainable development. For instance, <strong class="theme-color">Pinky Maheshwari</strong>- who was
                        apparently challenged by her son to make environmentally friendly paper ended up inventing handmade
                        paper made out of cotton that is embedded with seeds. These can even be planted and grown into trees
                        when the paper has served its purpose. Such an instance stands as a firm testimony that if a woman
                        can bring new life to Earth, she probably bears the capability of reviving a planet infected with
                        certain environmental and social demons.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>The struggle of women entrepreneurs over the past times certainly seems to bear fruit as the need
                        of development of women entrepreneurship has paved its way to the political outlook of the country.
                        The very recent <strong class="theme-color">Startup India Initiative</strong> aims to create and promote empowered women
                        entrepreneurs in this <strong class="theme-color">“golden age of globalization, digitalization, and start-up
                          booms.”</strong> The government initiative has already started to reflect outcomes in the sense
                        that of all the directors of startups, 35% are women.The entrepreneurship culture has also urged the
                        political authorities to make entrepreneurship education an insidious part of the education system
                        and not just remain the exclusive right of women belonging to upper middle class or rich class of
                        the society.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>The success stories have women entrepreneurs have indeed influenced the social fragment of the
                        country for the better. Such a change for the better is implicitly implied in more and more venture
                        capital supporting the cause of gender diversity in entrepreneurs and more and more angle investors
                        willing to invest in business ideas of women. </p>
    
                      <p>But all the transformations stated above cannot sugar coat the impact some of the ills of the
                        society have left upon us. One of these social demons is illiteracy, most of the women in India are
                        still ailing with this disease of illiteracy. <strong class="theme-color">Illiteracy</strong> may have serious impacts
                        on the development of a person as an entrepreneur as for being an entrepreneur, either a woman has
                        to be educated enough to convert a business idea into reality or should have access to adequate
                        mentorship for doing so. Most of the women who possess impeccably innovative business ideas still
                        lags behind in access to either adequate education or appropriate mentorship to even avail the
                        advantages offered by entrepreneurship development programs introduced by the government. </p>
    
                      <p> In a nutshell, overcoming this hurdle is the next level in this lengthy and glorious journey of
                        developing a women entrepreneurship culture in India.</p>
    
                      <p>An article on women entrepreneurship should indeed conclude with a quote from the very first woman
                        entrepreneur of the country:

                        Imagine the cricket team of <strong class="theme-color">India</strong> leaving for <strong class="theme-color"> West Indies</strong> for a
                        test series. All the match winning players with their exceptional cricketing skills are set to show
                        their best performance. As usual, the practice sessions are held before the main tournament begins.
                        But, what is going on? No one is there to review the performance of the batsmen. No one is there to
                        guide the team captain regarding positioning of field. No one is present on the ground to analyse
                        the pitch with his experience and predict if batting would be a better option or bowling. Woah!!!
                        The coach is not accompanying the team. So now, irrespective of the acumen possessed by the players,
                        will they be able to give their best in the absence of any mentorship?

                        fire with which he is motivated to give his best. The positioning of fielders would be the
                        appropriate allotment of funds, resources and brainstorming in various departments of his start-up,
                        then the role of coach is played by <strong class="theme-color"> BUSINESS INCUBATOR</strong>, the mentor of budding

                        Considering the current situation in our nation where start-up culture is already pretty much
                        underrated, role of business incubator becomes even more crucial. A newly formed start-up that is
                        already in the infant phase of its growth and development is truly mentored by a business incubator.
                        But most of us must be oblivious of what is a business incubator. A business incubator is a company
                        that helps start-up companies to develop by providing services such as management training or office
                        space and guidance to progress on the path of economic development. They not only provide the access
                        to various marketing plans and means of obtaining capital but also a range of more specialized
                        professional services.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        Let us talk about the importance of business incubators in various regions. Since highly
                        economically developed regions ultimately involve a very stiff competition among the newly growing
                        start-ups, thus the vitality of business incubators cannot be negated here. A start-up owner can
                        certainly not expect to be the jack of all trades, thus there must be different domains where his
                        knowledge would not be sufficient enough for taking decisions. Again, here comes another significant
                        aspect of the incubators that they play a major role in decision making processes for the start-up.
                      </p>
    
    
                      <p>
                        Furthermore, incubators offer numerous benefits to owners of start-up businesses. Their office and
                        manufacturing space is offered at below-market rates, and their staff supplies advice and
                        much-needed expertise in developing and expanding business. National Business Incubation Association
                        is a national website that maintains all the records of various incubators and which one to refer to
                        under various circumstances. Incubators demand a distinct fleshed-out business plan that is further
                        reviewed by their screening committee. <strong class="theme-color"> Incubators</strong> thereafter carefully screen
                        potential because even their space, equipment and finances are limited, and they want to be sure
                        they choose to nurture businesses with best possible chance to success.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        Over the time, even incubators have evolved. Earlier, they only focused on technology companies, but
                        the newer incubators work with companies from diverse industries. Incubators play a major role in
                        helping start-ups to save operating posts. Incubators help start-ups with their financing need by
                        referring them to <strong class="theme-color"> angel investors</strong> and venture capitalists and helping them with
                        the presentations. Start-ups can also take full use of the lower lease rates offered by incubators.
                        Moreover, start-ups may have better luck financing if they have the approval stamp of incubator
                        programs.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        In addition to financial aids, start-ups further need help to compete successfully with established
                        industry players. Incubators can tap into their networks of experienced entrepreneurs who can
                        provide management guidance and operational assistance. For example, a restaurant entrepreneur could
                        highly benefit from experienced hospitality industry services to learn about the difficulties of
                        overseas expansion. Start-ups benefit a lot from having respected individuals on board and
                        scientific advisory plans who bring invaluable experience and connection along with them.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        Furthermore, close working relationships between an incubator’s start-up create synergies. The
                        connections and networks created through incubators sustain for a long time. Start-up entrepreneurs
                        can provide motivation and encouragement to one another and employees may share new ideas on
                        approaches to problems. They may plan to join marketing campaigns and cooperate on product
                        development initiatives. Even though varying geographic location of different start-ups is a
                        challenge for start-ups to connect with each other. However, with increasing globalisation and
                        digitisation of the market, even this will not be an issue of concern in coming times and can be
                        easily resolved by providing a remote platform for start-up employees to brainstorm.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>By helping new businesses prosper, incubators also help in acting as employment generators for
                        their host communities. According to a report, start-ups in incubation programs have greater
                        viability to show superior financial performance over the long time. An estimated 40% of
                        investment-seeking member companies source investment through a direct incubator program connection.
                        They create long-lasting jobs for new graduates, experienced mid-career personnel and even for
                        veteran executives. This benefits the job-seeking communities a lot. Hence, this gives an invaluable
                        boost to the economy as well. </p>
    
                      <p>Moreover, having the business infrastructure in place and available and providing business services
                        and experts for the start-up to focus on key areas that matter the most, i.e. the core business
                        product. Start-ups are thereby able to focus their time, efforts, energy, and resources on creating,
                        evolving and testing their products. Thus, the essence of their business idea is protected and
                        security of resources is also provided by the incubator in order to let them focus on the target
                        they aspire to achieve. And this is the place where <strong class="theme-color"> Power2Create</strong> comes into
                        picture and helps the new ventures flourish in the market. </p>
    
                      <p>In a nutshell, we can say that for the budding entrepreneurs to rise and shine, incubators are a
                        blessing. The benefits that a start-up can extract out of an incubator are of immeasurable
                        importance. Business incubation is a concept that is highly misunderstood in our country. And
                        majority of people do not even know about it. Thus, spreading education and awareness about the
                        business incubators is the need of the hour. And this needs to be complemented with the government
                        policies as well. Conclusively, we cannot deny to the fact that business incubators play a vital
                        role to support entrepreneurs, new ventures and start-ups and not only provides required resources
                        but also opens a wide range of options to be explored and helps them gain an edge over other
                        start-ups of their domain.</p>

                        Have you ever visited a river rafting site? Well in case you have, then you might be pretty aware of
                        the scenario there- Some people out there can’t wait to get on the raft and ride through the river
                        of uncertainties, twists and turns, and risks. But there are some who just prefer to stay out of
                        this adventurous feat and watch from a distance and avoid any kind of risks and uncertainties.

                        A similar picture can be drawn in context of the acceptance of entrepreneurship in the world. All
                        around the globe, people share mixed feelings about the rising culture of entrepreneurship- some are
                        born with the spirit of entrepreneurship in their blood and can’t wait to build an empire and be
                        their own bosses. On the other hand, there are some whose only desire is to find an element of
                        stability and normalcy in their lives. This very situation arises because while some may see
                        entrepreneurship as their golden ticket to success, the others may see it as something which if
                        unsuccessful can put an end to their careers. The culture of entrepreneurship possesses some inherit
                        pros and cons:

                    <h3>Pros : </h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong class="theme-color">High degree of flexibility: </strong> An entrepreneur enjoys unlimited power in making
                      decisions regarding how much of work they are to perform, or the number of working hours, and even
                      about their workplace. Many of the entrepreneurs manipulate their working schedules according to
                      personal requirements and tend to allocate their effectively towards their families, hobbies,
                      recreation, or other areas of interest.</li>

                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Spontaneous decision making:</strong> The very essence of successful business is taking
                      decisions at the right time, avail the right opportunity, and in turn gets your business on the
                      right track. Being an entrepreneur, provides a person with immense authority to enable quicker
                      decision making and avail a business opportunity before someone else make a benefit out of it.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Challenging sprit:</strong> Every time the Sun rises, every time the morning birds
                      chirp, every time an entrepreneur open his/her eyes to a new day, it beholds within it a new
                      challenge with an all new excitement for him/her in the form of the changing business environment,
                      rising competitors, modified governmental policies, etc.</li>

                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Control:</strong> Entrepreneurship as a career offers a person to exercise absolute
                      control over his/her profession. He gets to decide what work is he going to do, or what the core
                      objectives of his business are going to be, or how would he like to serve his customers, or on
                      what prospect of business is he going to place greater emphasis on, whether it is profit
                      maximization or environmental concerns.</li>

                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Rational remuneration:</strong> En entrepreneurship concern doesn’t bear any chance of
                      unjust salary, rather an entrepreneur earns profit on the basis of his performance and as an
                      outcome is always rewarded a fair remuneration </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Cons : </h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Overburdening:</strong> Sometimes the absolute power and authority an entrepreneur
                      enjoys may prove to be a burden on that person in terms of work load and responsibility of being
                      accountable for either the success or the failure of a business organization.</li>

                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Lack of stability:</strong> Since an entrepreneur is remunerated in the form of profits
                      rather than a fixed salary, and it is a well know fact that profits bear a bane of being unstable.
                      Sometimes an entrepreneur may earn abnormally high profits and sometimes he may end up being
                      bankrupt too. In entrepreneurship, every outcome has an equal probability, so an entrepreneur has
                      to make his way through this tough road full of instabilities and unprecedented turns.</li>

                    <li><strong class="theme-color">Competition:</strong> A business concern in vulnerable to cut throat competition at all
                      times. So an entrepreneur has to evolve every single days in the form of new and unique features
                      in their products or services a and formulating a unique selling proposition (USP) for it to face
                      the competition. This is much evident in the case of Apple, Samsung and MI releasing very model
                      with unique and innovative features to compete in the market.</li>

                        Can you think of a <strong class="theme-color">Microsoft</strong> without <strong class="theme-color">William Henry gates</strong>,
                        popularly known as <strong class="theme-color">Bill Gates</strong>, or <strong class="theme-color">Facebook</strong> without <strong class="theme-color">Mark
                          Zuckerberg</strong>, or <strong class="theme-color">Google</strong> without Larry page, or Amazon without <strong class="theme-color">Jeff
                          Bezos</strong>? – I guess not. This is because the names of these entrepreneurs have been linked
                        with these infamous business ventures with such a firm thread that they are nearly inseparable and
                        evidently it becomes almost impossible to imagine these businesses without these names. The linking
                        thread here is called technology- technology is one the primary reasons that most of the successful
                        business ventures we can reminisce even exist.

                        Beholding its inception in the Silicon Valley back in the 1980s to <strong class="theme-color">Bangalore</strong>
                        (commonly known as the silicon valley of India) become the software development giant in the entire
                        world, technology has run its course, changing the way entrepreneurs dream, they way they think, the
                        way they develop their ideas, the way they launch their enterprises, and the way they reach the
                        pinnacle of the business world.

                    <p>
                        If we go back in time, the entrepreneurs while thinking of a business idea might plan of satisfying
                        a local requirement of the customers but in contemporary world, a person living in India might even
                        dream of addressing the needs of customers in the <strong class="theme-color">United States of America</strong>. While
                        the geographical distance between the two countries is 13,568 kilometers but technology has narrowed
                        it down to practical zero distance when it comes to expanding your business.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        If we think consciously, technology and entrepreneurs share a very intimate relationship that is
                        because both of them eventually have the same goal- evolution of the world. Basically, entrepreneurs
                        apply their minds in thinking evolutionary ideas and then use their favorite tool- technology to
                        manifest that evolutionary thinking into reality.
                      </p>
    
    
                      <p>
                        Now this close relationship contains within itself a high degree of co-dependence too. Why is that?-
                        This is because both of them are highly dependent on each other to achieve their common goals. For
                        instance, <strong class="theme-color">Bill Gates</strong> wouldn’t have been able to develop if there was no such thing
                        as software technology. But on the other side of the coin, how on earth would have Microsoft
                        transformed our lives if it wasn’t for the great entrepreneur <strong class="theme-color">Bill Gates</strong>’
                        evolutionary thinking. So, both (entrepreneurs and technology) both tend to serve each other’s
                        purpose to radically transform our lives.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        And as technology as implanted itself in every nook and corner of the world, this relationship
                        between tech and entrepreneurs have strengthened significantly and this increasing strength has
                        certainly increased the scope for development of both entrepreneurship and technological
                        development- the rise of technology has widened the scope in the business in the form of online
                        retailing, digital marketing, globalization, 24*7 customer support services, and so on. On the same
                        footage, the development of entrepreneurship has led the way to technological development with new
                        kinds of business-related software programs emerging on the scene.

                        In the early days, it was a convention that only big shot entrepreneurs can get hold of the
                        appropriate tech and build their business empires .But with the passage of time, technology has
                        become such indispensable part of business ventures that it has become one of the foundations of
                        even rising small-scale startups all around the globe.Do you feel that your entrepreneurship venture

                        Now let us draw an analogy here. The diver is a budding start-up with innovation and creativity all
                        set to make entry in the ocean of market. But what is the life-saving kit here? Life-saving kit,
                        here is the right choice that a start-up needs to make about the crucial factors that are going to
                        determine its future in the market. One of these includes the factors of technology and business
                        support. In the absence of these essential components of life support system, the entrepreneur and
                        his start-up would not be able to survive for long in market and this will be the point of regret
                        for them where they are going to realise the blunder that they did. But it would have got too late
                        by this time….

                    <p>
                        However, the best part is that it isn’t late right now. You can make the correct choices right now
                        in order to let the wings of your innovation and entrepreneurship fly high in the sky of success.
                        Every entrepreneur has ideas, right? Some of them are good, others not so good, while some being
                        exceptional. But what is it that differentiates a great idea from creating a successful start-up
                        company? Lots of hard work, yes! Dedication and many sleepless nights, yes! A bit of failure too,
                        yes! But something crucial still seems to be missing. A very significant factor that is going to
                        determine the future of a start-up is the planning of strategies and their execution.

                        Having an idea is one thing but having a legitimate and executable business plan is something
                        totally different. A proper business plan provides you an edge over other competitors of yours
                        trying to explore the same domain. But how to make one?
                      </p>
    
    
                      <p>
                        A business plan is nothing but a written description of your company’s future. You need to outline
                        what you want to do. You need to brainstorm how you want to execute it and how will you go about
                        with the strategies you have made to ensure success. Typically, these plans outline and determine
                        the first 3 to 5 years of your business strategy. Thus, it needs to be the first thing in your list
                        in order to check because you are going to use it in order to complete the remaining targets on your
                        list.

                      <p>
                        Furthermore, in this era of industrialization and globalisation, technology has become an
                        indispensable component of any and every business. Flourishing technological innovation is certainly
                        a key to success. In this domain, apart from employing technology in the external communication
                        systems of the company, even the focus needs to be shifted towards internally developed technology.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        Thus, inclusion of new technology in various domains has come up with multiple challenges as well.
                        Countering these challenges is an urgent issue of concern and need to be handled with
                        technologically sound managers with great intellect. They must serve both as technical developers
                        and implementers. The employees even though are not very much proficient in technology, they still
                        need to learn the required technical skills required. Then they can apply these technologies in the
                        areas they are knowledgeable about.
                      </p>
    
                      <p>
                        Thus, keeping above points we can say that apart from adopting advanced models for finance and
                        marketing, one even needs to give due attention to appropriate selection of technology and a
                        business plan in order to make his business do wonders!!!
